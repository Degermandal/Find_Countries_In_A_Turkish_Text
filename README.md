# Find_Countries_In_A_Turkish_Text
The program finds all countries that is in a given Turkish text.

All countries that is in the given text file are considered to have started with capital letters. 
Country names beginning with a lowercase letter are not considered as countries and are not included in the list.
The file where I read the country names is "file.txt". Short names of countries are taken as reference. 
(Like GERMANY instead of GERMANY FEDERAL REPUBLIC.) If you want to add the country name to in the file, 
it should be written in lower case only. This is because of lowercase letters are checked.
